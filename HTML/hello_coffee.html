	<p>Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, which are the seeds of berries from the Coffea plant. Once ripe, coffee beans are picked, processed, and dried. Green (unroasted) coffee beans are one of the most traded agricultural commodities in the world. Once traded, the coffee beans are roasted to varying degrees, depending on the desired flavor. Roasted beans are ground and brewed to produce coffee as a beverage.</p>
